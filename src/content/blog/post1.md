I am not a writer. I have no intention of becoming a writer. In fact, I'm not that fond of writing this post. So why subject myself to this torture? Well, bear with me as I explain.

In January 2024, I found myself among the many individuals in the tech industry facing a layoff from my Cloud Engineering position. Although the news came as a shock, it wasn't entirely unexpected. Faced with this news, I thought about the direction I wanted to steer my career and what new skills and technologies I would acquire. To become a writer, though? It's not at the top of my list.

So why blog? It's simple. I want a medium where I can write about cool tech and projects I'm working on. I don't expect anyone to see this, let alone read it. It's merely to keep myself accountable and maybe look back on it one day and appreciate the journey. If, by chance, my written communication skills ever so slightly improve, it wouldn't be unwelcome either.
